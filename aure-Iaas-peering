# 🔧 Azure IaaS Networking Project – Virtual Network Peering

This project demonstrates a hands-on implementation of **Azure Virtual Network (VNet) Peering** using Microsoft Azure's Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

## 🧩 Project Overview

Created a secure network setup using two virtual networks in the same Azure region, connected via VNet Peering, allowing seamless communication between virtual machines across networks.

---

## 🛠️ Key Objectives

1. Created two Virtual Networks (VNets) in the same region.
2. Deployed Virtual Machines (VMs) in each VNet.
3. Configured **bi-directional VNet Peering**:
   - East-to-West
   - West-to-East
4. Validated network connectivity between VMs across peered VNets.

## ⚙️ Tools & Services Used

- Microsoft Azure Portal  
- Virtual Networks (VNets)  
- Virtual Machines (Windows/Linux)  
- Network Security Groups (NSGs)  
- VNet Peering
